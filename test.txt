Hell is a living room

They wake approximately three hours before their alarm goes off, the time reads 6.12am. At 9.00am their alarm will sound and at 9.30am they have to get up and make breakfast for mother. Going back to sleep seems like an impossibility so for now they're content to stay awake and catch up on whatever's on their social media.

The phone brightness stings their eyes a bit in the darkness, even at the lowest setting, as they scroll through their feed: Parts of the world are on fire, people are depressed, everyone's getting older and there isn't enough care in the world to curb it. The people who could change things are silent. They switch to music for now, finding themself caught up enough at this point. They can hear their brother and father converse softly in the kitchen as they prepare to leave for work that day.

8.45am, they still haven't gone back to sleep. It's time to wake up anyway, hopefully coffee will get them through the day. They turn their alarm off before it can ring and collect their clothes so they can shower, it wakes them up a bit more.

At 9.15am they're in the kitchen, scooping premade oatmeal into a pan and adding almond milk to it before turning on the stove to warm it up. While that's heating up they take the loaf of bread they bought three days ago and take four slices out to make lunch with for when they head to work. It's nothing fancy, answering phones at a local hardware store, but you can't do much on just a high school diploma. Every little bit helps though and it gets them out of the house.

They seal away their lunch in a reusable lunch box and pour themself some cereal to eat for breakfast as they take a sip of their coffee. 

The oatmeal is warm by now so they spoon it into a bowl using their mother's favourite spoon and pour some coffee into her prefered mug. Their own breakfast cereal will soak in all the milk while they bring the oatmeal and coffee over.

The time is 9.45am now and they put on a smile before knocking on their mother's door and opening it with their elbow, their hands occupied with the breakfast items. "Good morning, mom."

Their mother smiles brightly for them, like she always does when he comes in, and she sits up straight. She looks exhausted, must not have slept again. The oxygen tube that's supposed to be on her nose is slightly ajar from lying down, she doesn't bother fixing it. "Good morning, Aram." 

Aram places the bowl on the foot end of the bed within his mother's reach and places the coffee on the bedside table to free up his hands and kisses her forehead.

He leaves her to her meal and returns to his own which is waiting for him on the kitchen counter. He takes it to the dining room to eat at the table and scrolls a bit more through his phone.

Right before they finish the last pieces of cereal they receive a text from their mom in the other room, "Can you please come over?"

Aram quickly scoops the last bits of cereal into their mouth and chugs down their mug of coffee so they can put it in the sink to wash before they leave and head to their mother's room again. She's in tears now, she hates being sick so much. She hates how dad and her oldest son look at her now. Aram can do little else but sit and listen to her cry it out. They hold her hand in the meantime and listen to their mother tell them how much she loves them and Aram smiles for her. Always smiles.

They'll be late to work again because of this, but hopefully work won't mind.
